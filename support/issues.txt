* sherpa should not reactivate sab during 'check' action if it was already stopped.

* status table intermittently(?) shows packages out-of-order:
	on TS-559Pro+:
	• QPKG name:         • QPKG statuses:       • QPKG version:  • QPKG installation path:
	ClamAV             - not installable: insufficient RAM
	Deluge-server      - disabled, inactive     230726           /share/MD0_DATA/.qpkg/Deluge-server
	duf                - enabled, active        220809           /share/MD0_DATA/.qpkg/duf
	Deluge-web         - disabled, inactive     230726           /share/MD0_DATA/.qpkg/Deluge-web

	on TS-230:
	• QPKG name:         • QPKG statuses:       • QPKG version:  • QPKG installation path:
	Deluge-server      - not installed
	ClamAV             - enabled, active        230726           /share/CACHEDEV2_DATA/.qpkg/ClamAV
	Deluge-web         - not installed
	duf                - enabled, active        220809           /share/CACHEDEV2_DATA/.qpkg/duf

* 'sherpa start inactive' fails to find any inactive packages.
	needs to get status of each package first.

* if package signing fails, the cert database is probably already open. Check for this and abort signing.
	also, when signing fails, don't direct user to the QPKG service-script log: signing isn't a service action.

* extend startup timeouts for Deluge QPKGs

* QPKG version sort is not correctly sorting version numbers followed by an alpha as later than non-alpha.

* if a forked action hangs, it might be killed by its caller.
	need to confirm this.
