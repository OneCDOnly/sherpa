* progress line display has extra whitespace(s) when displayed in colour on older NAS (QTS 4.2.6 & 4.3.3)

* RunLast: does not respond to '--status' query.
	need to add this to service script.

* progress line display desyncs intermittently (suspect stdout interference caused by an application start-up).
	must investigate NZBHydra and nzbToMedia.

* ensure each action fork is actually being killed after it issues an 'exit' into the message pipe.
