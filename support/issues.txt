* LazyLibrarian: can't install Levenshtein PyPI on armv5 (no compatible compiled binary) fails while building wheels for cmake & ninja, but Levenshtein is being installed indirectly via pyproject.toml. Need to find out how essential this module is to this application.

* RunLast: does not respond to '--status' query.
	need to add this to service script.

* progress line display desyncs intermittently (suspect stdout interference caused by an application start-up).
	must investigate NZBHydra and nzbToMedia.

* ensure each action fork is actually being killed after it issues an 'exit' into the message pipe.
