* figure-out how to trigger App Center to refresh package icon(s) when starting/stopping QPKG via the CLI (and in sherpa).

* add mini rolling CPU utilitisation graph to progress display while installing QPKGs?
    while true; do top -b -n 2 -d 0.2 -p 1621 | tail -1 | awk '{print $9}'; done
    while true; do /usr/bin/top -b -n2 -d1 | grep 20744 | tail -1 | awk '{print $7}'; done

* create a troubleshooting page for the wiki?
    This should include explanations of various ops like clean and check, so users will have a better idea which op to run when things go wrong.

* update IPKs automatically?
    Store a local checksum of the Entware package list. If this changes, assume it's been updated and all IPKs should be checked for upgrade status and upgraded. No-need to prompt user - just upgrade automatically.

* see if *arr package can be supported?

* make Entware check for package updates early-on in background?

* download QPKG updates in background when running sherpa for any reason?

* keep track of each package's action times and process the longest ones first next time?

* autowidth display columns?

* BASH completion?

* include new integrated help screens for all actions like:
    `sherpa paste help`, `sherpa install help`, `sherpa reassign help`

* add checks to all service scripts to examine $EUID.
    Maybe a way can be found to run each service script without superuser access?

* ensure each service script 'venv' upgrades its own 'pip'.

* include result and duration of IPKs and PIPs install/upgrade in session results.

* add pyLoad as new QPKG? username: pyload, password: pyload, source: https://github.com/pyload/pyload
	opkg install tesseract python3-curl
	python3 -m pip install pyload-ng
