* add new actions for sherpa: 'skipped' and 'failed':
	- these will list all QPKGs that were skipped or failed during the last sherpa session.
	- show the related action that was attempted, and the reasons for the skips or failures.

* SortMyQPKGs service script:
	- 'backup' should 'touch' the backup file, even when there's nothing to backup, to demonstrate the backup actually ran.

* user should be able to specify "debug to disk" and/or "debug to screen".

* sherpa being run with a 'status' check during QTS startup on Laura. Why?

* SABnzbd service script:
	- attempting to 'start' when already started creates 'unknown' service script status.

* sherpa service script:
	- attempting to 'restart' creates 'unknown' service script status.

* Deluge-web service script:
	- increase port check timeouts to 120 seconds, to better suit old ARMv5 CPUs.

* nzbToMedia service script:
	- when QPKG is disabled, still shows $link_path details.

* remove message to 'enable' QPKG when attempting to 'stop' it while in a disabled state:

	[~] # /etc/init.d/clamav.sh stop; echo $?
	The 'ClamAV' QPKG is disabled. Please enable it first with: qpkg_service enable ClamAV
