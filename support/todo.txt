* suspect deluge-server and deluge-web can't be started at exactly the same time. deluge-web fails port check.
	Maybe introduce a delay for deluge-web when starting via sherpa and also starting deluge-server?

* user should be able to specify "debug to disk" and/or "debug to screen".

* sherpa being run with a 'status' check during QTS startup on Laura. Why?

* remove message to 'enable' QPKG when attempting to 'stop' it while in a disabled state:

	[~] # /etc/init.d/clamav.sh stop; echo $?
	The 'ClamAV' QPKG is disabled. Please enable it first with: qpkg_service enable ClamAV
	1

* add mini rolling CPU graph to progress display while installing QPKGs?
