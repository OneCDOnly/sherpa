* add checks to all service scripts to examine $EUID.
    Maybe a way can be found to run each service script without superuser access?

* after removing entware, 'sed' and 'grep' fail. Ensure changeover to QTS binaries works correctly.

* change sherpa QPKG icon to use transparency.
    do the same to RunLast.

* ensure each venv upgrades its own 'pip'.

* ensure each action fork is actually being killed after it issues an 'exit' into the message pipe.

* add mini rolling CPU utilitisation graph to progress display while installing QPKGs?
    while true; do top -b -n 2 -d 0.2 -p 1621 | tail -1 | awk '{print $9}'; done
    while true; do /usr/bin/top -b -n2 -d1 | grep 20744 | tail -1 | awk '{print $7}'; done

* user should be able to specify "debug to disk" and/or "debug to screen". 'debug-screen' should also enable 'debug-disk'.

* remove hint to 'enable' QPKG when attempting to 'stop' it while in a disabled state:
    [~] # /etc/init.d/clamav.sh stop; echo $?
    The 'ClamAV' QPKG is disabled. Please enable it first with: qpkg_service enable ClamAV
