    • These package actions were skipped:

            Reason: already installed

* after removing entware, 'sed' and 'grep' commands fail for the remainder of that session. Must ensure changeover to QTS binaries works correctly.

* ensure each action fork is actually being killed after it issues an 'exit' into the message pipe.

* remove hint to 'enable' QPKG when attempting to 'stop' it while in a disabled state:
    [~] # /etc/init.d/clamav.sh stop; echo $?
    The 'ClamAV' QPKG is disabled. Please enable it first with: qpkg_service enable ClamAV
