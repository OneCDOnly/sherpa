The world's first multi-action CLI package-manager!

Package management via [b]sherpa[/b] provides extra features like easy application backup, upgrading, service and daemon management, self-checking and repair, and all operations may be automated via cron.

[list][b][color=#A371F7]Important:[/color][/b] this is a command-line package and service manager, it's in beta status, and packages have been known to break due to auto-upgrades going wrong. If you would like-to (and are able-to) help by diagnosing and providing logs, and don't mind things breaking from time-to-time, please use this package. If you're looking for complete stability and want a "set-and-forget" solution, it won't be found here just yet. [b]Do not[/b] use sherpa in production environments, unless you're comfortable with the CLI and debugging bash and Python scripts, and/or can afford for applications to be out-of-order for extended periods of time.

That said: the majority of development is now complete, and I'm currently working-on increasing stability during auto-package upgrades. So, [b]sherpa[/b] will work beautifully on a fresh (or new) system, but can experience issues when individual application updates are released.
