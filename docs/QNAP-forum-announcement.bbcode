[b][u][size=150]sherpa: a mini-package-manager for QNAP NAS[/size][/u][/b]

[url=https://github.com/OneCDOnly/sherpa/releases/latest][img]https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/OneCDOnly/sherpa?logo=github&label=latest%20release[/img][/url] [img]https://img.shields.io/badge/release_status-beta-orange?logo=github[/img] [img]https://img.shields.io/date/1494050732?logo=github&label=project%20launch[/img]

The world's first multi-action CLI package-manager!

Package management via [b]sherpa[/b] provides features like easy application backup, upgrading, service and daemon management, multi-threaded operation, self-checking and repair, and all operations may be automated via cron.

[list][b][color=#A371F7]Important:[/color][/b] this is a command-line package and service manager, it's in beta status, and packages have been known to break due to auto-upgrades going wrong. If you would like-to (and are able-to) help by diagnosing and providing logs, and don't mind things breaking from time-to-time, please use this package. If you're looking for complete stability and want a "set-and-forget" solution, it won't be found here just yet. [color=#F85149][b]Do not[/b][/color] use [b]sherpa[/b] in production environments, unless you're comfortable with the CLI and debugging bash and Python scripts, and/or can afford for applications to be out-of-order for extended periods of time.

That said: the majority of development is now complete, and I'm currently working-on increasing stability during auto-package upgrades. So, [b]sherpa[/b] will work beautifully on a fresh (or new) system, but can experience issues when individual application updates are released.
