* need to ensure required.txt/recommended.txt mods do not interupt app internal git update.

* ensure 'recommended.txt' for each project is parsed for cffi/cryptography modules - same as 'required.txt'

	might be able to use qpkg_cli for this.

* progress line display desyncs intermittently (suspect stdout interference caused by LazyLibrarian startup).

* ensure each action fork is actually being killed after it issues an 'exit' into the message pipe.
