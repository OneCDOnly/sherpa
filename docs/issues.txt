* if QPKG is manually stopped (via service script), sherpa status table shows as still "enabled, started"
	this is because QPKG is not disabled when stopping via service script, and sherpa doesn't confirm if package is still running or not when collecting statuses.

* progress line display desyncs intermittently (suspect stdout interference caused by LazyLibrarian startup).

* ensure each action fork is actually being killed after it issues an 'exit' into the message pipe.
