sherpa: a mini-package-manager for QNAP NAS
============================================
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/OneCDOnly/sherpa?logo=github&label=latest%20release)](https://github.com/OneCDOnly/sherpa/releases/latest) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/release_status-beta-orange?logo=github) ![Project Launch](https://img.shields.io/date/1494050732?logo=github&label=project%20launch)

The world's first multi-action CLI package-manager!

Package management via **sherpa** provides features like easy application backup, upgrading, service and daemon management, multi-threaded operation, self-checking and repair, and all operations may be automated via cron.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a command-line package and service manager, it's in beta status, and packages have been known to break due to auto-upgrades going wrong. If you would like-to (and are able-to) help by diagnosing and providing logs, and don't mind things breaking from time-to-time, please use this package. If you're looking for complete stability and want a "set-and-forget" solution, it won't be found here just yet. <b>Do not</b> use <b>sherpa</b> in production environments, unless you're comfortable with the CLI and debugging bash and Python scripts, and/or can afford for applications to be out-of-order for extended periods of time.
>
> That said: the majority of development is now complete, and I'm currently working-on increasing stability during auto-package upgrades. So, <b>sherpa</b> will work beautifully on a fresh (or new) system, but can experience issues when individual application updates are released.
