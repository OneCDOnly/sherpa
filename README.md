a BASH script to install SABnzbd+, SickRage & CouchPotato into a QNAP NAS

<u><big>Description</big></u>

With this, you can install SABnzbd+, SickRage and CouchPotato. It's the advanced version of the [sabnzbd-installer](https://forum.qnap.com/viewtopic.php?f=133&t=129696) script that I've been working on with much valuable feedback from the community. Development has now ceased on the older script so I can concentrate on this one. 

The information contained therein was constructed from the efforts of many community members, both here and on the SABnzbd forum. Thank you to everyone who has contributed.
