* 'pyload.sh status' causing undefined directory creation in CWD.
	- also WebSSH.

* 'sherpa install all start all' doesn't start deactivated QPKGs.

* progress display text sometimes desyncs during installation of OMedusa QPKG.
	- Example: proc: reinstalling dependent QPKGs ... 36% (7/21), 7 OK36% (7/21), 7 OK, 1 in-progress
	- Suspect Medusa application (or service script) is outputting something to stderr.

* 'sherpa list installed' & 'not-installed' not listing anything.

* near the end of installing IPKs, monitored download path can remain at non-zero size while packages complete installation.
	- Maybe include a separate progress message when dir size shrinks to almost zero.

* 'sherpa start inactive' fails to find any inactive packages.
	- Must get status of each package first.

* if package signing fails, the cert database is probably already open. Check for this and abort signing.
	- Also, when signing fails, don't direct user to the QPKG service-script log: signing isn't a service action.

* extend startup timeouts for Deluge QPKGs.

* QPKG version sort is not correctly sorting version numbers followed by an alpha as later than non-alpha.

* if a forked action hangs, it might not be killed by its caller.
	- Need to confirm this.
