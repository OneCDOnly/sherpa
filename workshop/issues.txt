Observed issues:

	* armv5 (Helga) is cutting-off debug log early when running 'sherpa s olive verbose' due to SIGINT.

	* Allow Kapowarr to follow source git branch, release or tag.

	* When aborting sherpa, must also ensure child procs abort.
		- Presently, if a child proc is waiting to check PID again, it doesn't abort.
		- Try https://stackoverflow.com/a/2173421

	* 'sherpa show status' displays status report correctly, and then displays 'show' usage examples.

	* 'sherpa help show' is only showing basic help, not the 'show' help list.

	* SABNzbd failed during install, shows error, but install is marked as OK:

		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		- Original cause of install failure has been fixed, so will need to simulate an error to test.

	* Function durations can become incorrect when functions with the same name are called recursively.
		- Need to make vars holding start-times unique. Maybe measure nest depth?

	* Removing OMedusa QPKG via sherpa didn't update App Center 'live' (icon remained until App Center was manually refreshed).

	* Upgrading QPKGs via sherpa didn't update App Center icons 'live'.

	* Headphones didn't report 'stop' as successful.

		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		log ended here like process had been killed.

		- Applications was dead.

	* Near the end of installing IPKs, monitored download path can remain at non-zero size while packages complete installation.
		- Include a separate progress message when dir size shrinks?

	* QPKG version sort is not correctly sorting version numbers followed by an alpha as later than non-alpha.

Reported issues:

	* none.

Hypothetical issues:

	* If a forked action hangs, it might not be killed by its caller.
		- Need to test this.
