Observed issues:

	* 'sherpa start inactive' fails to find any inactive packages.
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		[/share/Public] # ./sherpa-manager.source start inactive
		sherpa v<?build_date?>-unstable
		warn: unable to find any packages to 'activate'.
		done: actions complete.

		[/share/Public] #
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		- Must get 'status' of each package first.

	* Function durations can become incorrect when functions with the same name are called recursively.
		- Need to make vars holding start-times unique. Maybe measure nest depth?

	* Removing OMedusa QPKG via sherpa didn't update App Center 'live' (icon remained until App Center was manually refreshed).

	* Upgrading QPKGs via sherpa didn't update App Center icons 'live'.

	* Deluge-server and Headphones didn't report 'stop' as successful.

		log ended here like process had been killed.

		- Both applications were dead.

	* Near the end of installing IPKs, monitored download path can remain at non-zero size while packages complete installation.
		- Maybe include a separate progress message when dir size shrinks to almost zero?

	* Extend startup timeouts for Deluge QPKGs?
		- Frankly, Deluge-web is a colossal PITA. Consider removing support for this as a QPKG.

	* QPKG version sort is not correctly sorting version numbers followed by an alpha as later than non-alpha.

Reported issues:

	* none.

Hypothetical issues:

	* If a forked action hangs, it might not be killed by its caller.
		- Need to test this.
