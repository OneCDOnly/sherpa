Observed issues:

	* Ensure 'list versions' report shows number formats same as 'about' report.

	* Extra derp when running actions with no matching packages after reset:
		-------------------------------------------------------------------
		[/share/Public] # sherpa follow unstable
		done: user setting 'Git_Branch = unstable' has been saved.
		done: package cache cleared.
		done: reports cleared.
		done: logs cleared.
		[/share/Public] # sherpa upgrade new
		sherpa v241002-unstable
		warn: unable to find any 'upgradable' QPKGs to 'upgrade'.
		done: actions complete.
		derp: previous report results not found.
		-------------------------------------------------------------------

	* Packages report (with 'report-footer off') has 3 linespaces between last QPKG name and abbreviations reminder text.

	* If IPK install stalls, seconds stalled display is not accurate.
		- Need to calculate actual seconds elapsed since stall began, instead of using an accumulator and `sleep 1`.

	* If an action fork fails (such as with "unbound variable" error), main loop stalls.
		- Must save stderr to file, and exit main loop.

	* Will need a new method to detect if QTS 5.2.0 is starting/stopping QPKGs due to async starts/stops.

	* Near the end of installing IPKs, monitored download path can remain at non-zero size while packages complete installation.
		- Include a separate progress message when dir size stops increasing and shrinks instead? Maybe force increase to "100%" and stop monitoring?

	* 'sherpa' and 'opkg' were not available after installing Entware.
		- Entware installation may be corrupt.
		- But this shouldn't affect the sherpa command `/usr/sbin/sherpa`.
		- Restarting sherpa got this going again.
		- Retest.

	* FIXED: When a QPKG couldn't be signed (due to no 'sqlite3'), it's not shown by QPKGs.Actions:List() at-all.
		- QPKG was 'skipped-abort', and is shown as 'skipped' in results.
		- TODO: Other QPKGs to be signed were not shown in either list. Must add them to 'skipped-abort' list.

	* When aborting sherpa, must also ensure backgrounded procs abort.
		- UPDATE: working fine, possibly won't need BG_PROCS_PATH anymore. Test to confirm.

	* Function durations can become incorrect when functions with the same name are called recursively.
		- Need to make vars holding start-times unique. Maybe measure nest depth? Use epoch time in name?

	* QPKG version sort is not correctly sorting version numbers followed by an alpha as later than non-alpha.

	# QTS/QuTS App Center

		* Removing OMedusa QPKG via sherpa didn't update App Center 'live' (icon remained until App Center was manually refreshed).

		* Upgrading QPKGs via sherpa didn't update App Center icons 'live'.

Reported issues:

	* none.

Hypothetical issues:

	* If a forked action hangs, it might not be killed by its caller.
		- Need to test this.
