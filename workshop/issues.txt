* Glances 'stop' does kill main PID, but then a second PID is found by service script, so it reports the 'stop' as failed.

* ClamAV not starting, but showing 'start' as OK.
	[~] # /etc/init.d/clamav.sh start debug
	source: clamav.sh, action: start, datetime: Thu Jan 18 08:37:35 EST 2024

* progress display text sometimes desyncs during installation of OMedusa QPKG.
	example: proc: reinstalling dependent QPKGs ... 36% (7/21), 7 OK36% (7/21), 7 OK, 1 in-progress
	suspect Medusa (or service script) is outputting something to stderr.

* 'sherpa list installed' & 'not-installed' not listing anything.

* near the end of installing IPKs, monitored download path can remain at non-zero size while packages complete installation.
	maybe include a separate progress message when dir size shrinks to almost zero.

* 'sherpa start inactive' fails to find any inactive packages.
	needs to get status of each package first.

* if package signing fails, the cert database is probably already open. Check for this and abort signing.
	also, when signing fails, don't direct user to the QPKG service-script log: signing isn't a service action.

* extend startup timeouts for Deluge QPKGs.

* QPKG version sort is not correctly sorting version numbers followed by an alpha as later than non-alpha.

* if a forked action hangs, it might not be killed by its caller.
	need to confirm this.
