Observed issues:

	* Default dependency report should only show installed QPKGs.
		- ... but should allow 'sherpa d all' to see all QPKGs.
		- Do the same for repository report.
		- Add new $QPKG_ACTIONS element: 'report'

	* Disable same-line display updates when not in a user terminal.
		- No-need to record every progress message change in logs.

	* Only install IPKs for QPKGs that download successfully (or are already downloaded).
		- ... and the installed ones, as-happens now.

	* Results report wording should account for single QPKG actions.
		- Don't pluralise "package actions" when there was only one.

	* x86 (Sarah) is writing files into /root/.cache

		- Narrowed this down to WebSSH.
		- Doesn't happen on aarch64 (Laura).

	* Takes ~3.5 - 6 seconds to build QPKG states on Laura.
		- Should be able to do this quicker.
		- Calculate QPKG features separate to states and cache/load these from file next time?

	* Python module cleaner in service library functions is removing PyPI packages with a partial name match.
		- Must be changed to an exact match.

	* 'sherpa' and 'opkg' were not available after installing Entware.
		- Entware installation may be corrupt.
		- But this shouldn't affect the sherpa command `/usr/sbin/sherpa`.
		- Restarting sherpa got this going again.

	* FIXED: When a QPKG couldn't be signed (due to no 'sqlite3'), it's not shown by QPKGs.Actions:List() at-all.
		- QPKG was skipped-abort, and is shown as a skipped QPKG in results.
		- TODO: Other QPKGs to be signed were not shown in either list.

	* armv5 (Helga) is cutting-off debug log early when running 'sherpa s olive verbose' due to SIGINT.

	* When aborting sherpa, must also ensure backgrounded procs abort.
		- UPDATE: working fine, possibly won't need BG_PROCS_PATH anymore. Test to confirm.

	* 'sherpa show status' displays status report correctly, and then displays 'show' usage examples.

	* 'sherpa help show' is only showing basic help, not the 'show' help list.

	* Function durations can become incorrect when functions with the same name are called recursively.
		- Need to make vars holding start-times unique. Maybe measure nest depth?

	* Removing OMedusa QPKG via sherpa didn't update App Center 'live' (icon remained until App Center was manually refreshed).

	* Upgrading QPKGs via sherpa didn't update App Center icons 'live'.

	* Near the end of installing IPKs, monitored download path can remain at non-zero size while packages complete installation.
		- Include a separate progress message when dir size shrinks?

	* QPKG version sort is not correctly sorting version numbers followed by an alpha as later than non-alpha.

Reported issues:

	* none.

Hypothetical issues:

	* If a forked action hangs, it might not be killed by its caller.
		- Need to test this.
