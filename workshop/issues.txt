Observed issues:

	* armv5 (Helga) install of Sickgear is attempting to install 'python3-orjson' when it shouldn't.
	    - IPK doesn't exist in the pre-February 2024 Entware package list.
	    - a19 has its own IPK requires list for Sickgear in 'packages.source', so this shouldn't be happening.

	* 'sherpa show status' displays status report correctly, and then displays 'show' usage examples.

	* 'sherpa help show' is only showing basic help, not the 'show' help list.

	* SABNzbd failed during install, shows error, but install is marked as OK:

		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		- Original cause of install failure has been fixed, so will need to simulate an error to test.

	* Some QPKGs won't 'start' because app is already runing.
		- When QPKGs start, should run full status check first to ensure existing PID file is accurate.
		- Don't just run a basic daemon/process check.

	* Function durations can become incorrect when functions with the same name are called recursively.
		- Need to make vars holding start-times unique. Maybe measure nest depth?

	* Removing OMedusa QPKG via sherpa didn't update App Center 'live' (icon remained until App Center was manually refreshed).

	* Upgrading QPKGs via sherpa didn't update App Center icons 'live'.

	* Deluge-server and Headphones didn't report 'stop' as successful.

		log ended here like process had been killed.

		- Both applications were dead.

	* Near the end of installing IPKs, monitored download path can remain at non-zero size while packages complete installation.
		- Maybe include a separate progress message when dir size shrinks to almost zero?

	* Extend startup timeouts for Deluge QPKGs?
		- Frankly, Deluge-web is a colossal PITA. Consider removing support for this as a QPKG.

	* QPKG version sort is not correctly sorting version numbers followed by an alpha as later than non-alpha.

Reported issues:

	* none.

Hypothetical issues:

	* If a forked action hangs, it might not be killed by its caller.
		- Need to test this.
